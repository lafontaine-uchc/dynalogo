# Dynalogo

Dynalogo can be run with the following code from within RStudio or deployed on a shiny server.

To ensure compatibility, the user can download the current list of packages and Version numbers from the Dynalogo webite by clicking on the "Version Info" text at the top of the application located at https://dynalogo.cam.uchc.edu

If running on a shiny server, the user must ensure that the temp folder has the permissions set so the shiny user(or the user under which the shiny server is running) can read and write to the folder. If this is not set correctly the version info download may not work properly.
